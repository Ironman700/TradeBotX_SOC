# TradeBotX_SOC

## My Trading Journey & Project Overview

This project represents the culmination of my journey into algorithmic trading and quantitative finance, starting from basic stock market concepts to implementing advanced backtesting systems. The TradeBotX_SOC platform combines trading algorithms with a security operations center (SOC) to ensure both performance and safety.

### Learning Path

My trading journey began with Zerodha Varsity, where I systematically worked through:

1. **Stock Market Basics** - Understanding exchanges, order types, market mechanics, and trading infrastructure
2. **Technical Analysis** - Learning chart patterns, indicators, and momentum strategies
3. **Fundamental Analysis** - Studying financial statements, valuation metrics, and economic indicators
4. **Risk Management** - Implementing position sizing, stop-loss techniques, and portfolio management

After building this theoretical foundation, I moved to practical implementation through:
- Coding my first trading indicators (Moving Averages, RSI)
- Building complete trading systems with entry/exit rules
- Creating a comprehensive backtesting framework to evaluate strategy performance

## Implemented Strategies

This repository contains several trading strategies I've implemented and backtested:

### 1. Moving Average Crossover Strategy
Located in `AlgoTradingBacktester/MAStrategy.py`, this strategy:
- Uses short and long-term moving averages (default: 5 and 20 periods)
- Generates buy signals when short MA crosses above long MA
- Generates sell signals when short MA crosses below long MA
- Includes position sizing and risk management

### 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI) Strategy
Located in `AlgoTradingBacktester/RSIStrategy.py`, this strategy:
- Uses RSI indicator with configurable period (default: 14)
- Generates buy signals in oversold conditions (RSI < 30)
- Generates sell signals in overbought conditions (RSI > 70)
- Includes hysteresis to avoid excessive trading at threshold boundaries

### 3. Basic Market Making Strategy
Located in `AlgoTradingBacktester/OptimalTrader.py`, this strategy:
- Places simultaneous buy and sell orders around mid-market
- Aims to profit from bid-ask spreads and market microstructure
- Manages inventory and limits position exposure

## Backtesting Framework

The core of this project is a robust backtesting system I developed to accurately evaluate trading strategies:

### Key Features:

- **Event-driven architecture**: Processes market data tick-by-tick for realistic simulation
- **Orderbook simulation**: Full limit order book implementation with market depth
- **FIFO position tracking**: Accurate P&L calculation using first-in-first-out accounting
- **Performance metrics**: Calculates drawdown, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and other metrics
- **Trade visualization**: Interactive charts to analyze entry/exit points and equity curves

### Backtester Components:
- `src/backtester.py`: Core backtesting engine with order matching and position tracking
- `AlgoTradingBacktester/GUI.py`: Modern GUI interface for loading data and visualizing results

## Running Backtests

The platform features a sophisticated GUI for conducting backtests:

1. Load price data (order book snapshots)
2. Load trade data (market trades)
3. Select a trading strategy implementation
4. Run the backtest and analyze performance metrics
5. View interactive results with P&L, position size, and trade markers

## Technical Analysis Implementation

Based on my Zerodha Varsity learning, I've implemented several technical indicators:

- **Moving Averages**: Simple, Exponential, and Weighted for trend identification
- **Oscillators**: RSI for overbought/oversold conditions, MACD for momentum
- **Volume Indicators**: On-Balance Volume (OBV) and Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
- **Volatility Measures**: Bollinger Bands, Average True Range (ATR)

Each indicator is carefully calibrated and validated against known implementations to ensure accuracy.

## Fundamental Analysis Methods

While the current codebase focuses on technical strategies, I've incorporated fundamental analysis through:

- Data pipeline for financial statement integration
- Ratio-based filters for strategy inputs
- Sector-based position weighting
- Economic calendar event handling

## Future Development

The project is continuously evolving with planned improvements:

- **Machine Learning**: Integration of ML models for market regime detection
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Processing news and social media for market sentiment
- **High-Frequency Features**: Enhanced market microstructure analytics
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Multi-asset allocation strategies

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy, Pandas, Plotly
- Tkinter for GUI components

## Lessons Learned

My journey from Zerodha Varsity to building this platform has taught me:

1. **Market Knowledge is Essential**: Understanding market mechanics is crucial before automation
2. **Robust Backtesting Matters**: Historical performance needs careful validation
3. **Risk Management is Critical**: Even great strategies fail without proper risk controls
4. **Simplicity Works**: Often simpler strategies outperform complex ones
5. **Continuous Learning**: Markets evolve, requiring constant adaptation and learning
